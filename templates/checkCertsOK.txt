The Managed Proxies Service is reporting that no certs will be expiring within 30 days. The next cert to expire will be: 

{{ printf "\n%-20s" "Account" }}{{ printf "\t%11s\t%-s" "Days Left" "DN" }}
{{ range . }}
{{ printf "%-20s" .Account }}{{ printf "\t%11d\t%-s" .DaysLeft .DN }}
{{ end }}


{{/* This template is to report to the administrators that there are no impending expirations of service certificates. We're expecting a slice of structs with Account, DN string, DaysLeft int */}}
